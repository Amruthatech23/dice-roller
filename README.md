##  How I Built This

1. I started by creating a basic HTML and CSS layout for the dice interface.
2. Then I added JavaScript to handle:
   - Turn logic between players
   - Random dice value generation
   - Updating the dice images accordingly
3. Implemented animation with CSS to simulate dice rolling.
4. Added a dropdown to choose number of players dynamically.
5. Added audio using a dice roll sound effect.
6. Enhanced the app with responsive design for better user experience.



##  What I Learned

- JavaScript event handling and timing functions
- DOM manipulation and image swapping
- Managing multi-user turn systems
- CSS animations and transitions
- Audio playback in web apps
- Embedding media into GitHub READMEs
